# Diabetes Risk Assessment using Machine Learning

## ⚠️ Medical Disclaimer
This project is developed strictly for **educational purposes only**.  
It is **not intended** to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent diabetes.  
Predictions generated by this model **must not** be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.  
Always consult a **qualified healthcare professional** for medical decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview
Diabetes is a growing global health concern, and early detection plays a crucial role in prevention and management.  
This project uses **machine learning techniques** to assess diabetes risk based on patient health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and family history.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data-driven models can support **early-stage risk screening** in healthcare.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset  
- **Total Records**: 768  
- **Target Variable**: `Outcome`  
  - `1` → Diabetic  
  - `0` → Non-Diabetic  

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
- Identified **medically invalid zero values** in the following features:
  - Glucose
  - Insulin
  - Blood Pressure
  - BMI
- Treated zero values as **missing data**
- Applied **median imputation**, which is appropriate for healthcare datasets as it is robust to outliers

---

## 🧠 Feature Engineering
- BMI categorized into:
  - Underweight
  - Normal
  - Overweight
  - Obese
- Age grouped into **risk-based categories**
- Glucose levels categorized into:
  - Normal
  - Prediabetes
  - Diabetes
- Categorical features encoded using **one-hot encoding**

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The following evaluation metrics were used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

### Key Observations
- **Logistic Regression** provides balanced performance across metrics
- **Naive Bayes** achieves very high **recall** for diabetic patients
- In medical screening tasks, **recall is prioritized** to minimize false negatives

---

## 🎯 Why Recall Matters More Than Accuracy in Medical AI
In medical risk assessment, **recall is more important than accuracy**.

A **false negative** means a diabetic patient is incorrectly classified as healthy, which can delay diagnosis and treatment.

- Logistic Regression offers balanced accuracy
- Naive Bayes achieves **very high recall**, meaning it rarely misses actual diabetes cases

➡ For **early-stage diabetes screening**, a model with higher recall is preferred even if overall accuracy is lower.

---

## 🩺 Key Health Insights from the Model
- High **glucose levels** are the strongest indicator of diabetes risk
- **BMI and obesity category** significantly increase diabetes probability
- **Age above 35** shows higher risk, especially when combined with high BMI
- **Insulin irregularities** strongly correlate with positive diabetes outcomes
- Patients with multiple moderate risk factors may still be classified as high-risk, highlighting the importance of early screening

➡ These insights demonstrate how machine learning can **support preventive healthcare decisions**, not replace doctors.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare with a strong focus on:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Medically relevant evaluation metrics

**Naive Bayes** is particularly suitable for **early-stage diabetes risk screening** due to its high recall.
